# Introduction

These are the legacy tutorials for the first version of the Montreal Forced Aligner, FAVE-align, and the Penn Phonetics Lab Forced Aligner. The documentation for FAVE-align and Penn Forced Aligner is marked as "legacy" as the HTK toolkit these aligners depend on is no longer supported; similarly, the first version of the Montreal Forced Aligner has now been replaced by a very different second version. (I will emphasize here though that **FAVE-extract** will still work!)
